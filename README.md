## üïπÔ∏è GDevelop Extensions

This is the place where I store my GDevelop extensions. I hope they can be published as official or community ones :D

## How to install

- Download / Clone the repo
- In your GDevelop project, open the project manager
- Click the "+" button next to the Extensions collapse
- At the bottom of the "Search for New Extensions", click the "Import extension"
- Select the json file matching the extension you want to use in your project.
